# Joins and Spatial Joins

In multiple scenarios you will find information in one table/layer that you want to tranfer into another. **JOINS** are the best way to do that; all you need is a common _attribute_. When two tables share one attribute (including _data types_), you can expand the attributes in one of the tables and use it for further analysis and/or visualision purposes.

## Join Types 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Inner Join**: Returns rows with matching attributes.
- **Left (Outer) Join**: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched attributes from the right table.
- **Right (Outer) Join**: Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched attributes from the left table.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Full (Outer) Join**: Returns rows from both tables even when there is no matching attributes.
- **Cross Join**: Returns a Cartesian product of the two tables.
- **Self Join**: A table can be joined with itself.

### One-to-One
Occurs when each record in one table corresponds to exactly one record in another table.

###  One-to-Many
Occurs when a single record in one table can be associated with one or more records in another table.

- When using joins you are not modifying the original tables.
- Your resulting table can be much smaller or (exponentially) larger than any of the original tables.

## Introduction to Spatial Joins
- Understanding spatial joins: combining spatial data based on their location.
Types of spatial joins: intersect, within, contain, etc.
