# Joins and Spatial Joins

In multiple scenarios you will find information in one table/layer that you want to tranfer into another. **JOINS** are the best way to do that; all you need is a common _attribute_. When two tables share one attribute (including _data types_), you can expand the attributes in one of the tables and use it for further analysis and/or visualision purposes.

## Join Types 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Inner Join**: Returns rows with matching attributes.
- **Left (Outer) Join**: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched attributes from the right table.
- **Right (Outer) Join**: Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched attributes from the left table.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Full (Outer) Join**: Returns rows from both tables even when there is no matching attributes.
- **Cross Join**: Returns a Cartesian product of the two tables.
- **Self Join**: A table can be joined with itself.

## Cardinality

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="32%"}
### One-to-One
Occurs when each record in one table corresponds to exactly one record in another table.

::: {.column width="2%"}

::: {.column width="32%"}
###  One-to-Many
Occurs when a single record in one table can be associated with one or more records in another table.

### Many-to-Many
Occurrs when multiple records from one table correspond with one or more in another table.

- When using joins you are not modifying the original tables.
- Your resulting table can be much smaller or (exponentially) larger than any of the original tables.

## Introduction to Spatial Joins

Similar to joining tables based on their attributes, one can **join them based on their location** (_ultimately the location is nothing more than a 'fancy' attribute_).

To achieve the expected results, **make sure that both origin tables are in the same CRS**.

### Spatial predicates
In order to establish the relationship between the origin tables one can use a series of **spatial predicates**. The most common ones are:

- `Contains`: Determines if one geometry contains another.
- `Within`: Checks if one geometry is within another geometry.
- `Intersects`: Tests if two geometries intersect at any point.
- `Disjoint`: Determines if two geometries do not intersect.
- `Touches`: Checks if two geometries have at least one point in common but their interiors do not intersect.
- `Crosses`: Determines if the geometries have some, but not all, interior points in common.
- `Equals`: Checks if two geometries are exactly the same in terms of spatial coordinates.
- `Overlaps`: Determines if two geometries overlap, meaning they share some but not all points, and the intersection has the same dimension as the geometries themselves.

:::{.callout-caution}
Please note that depending on the size and complexity of your joins some operations can be **computationally expensive** and some advanced techniques might need to be implemented to achieve best performance.

# Saving Styles

In QGIS a _style_ actually refers to several categories such as : symbology, labels, table attributes settings, 3D views, etc. 
It is important to remember that all of this metadata does not affect the underlying values of the layers. This gives a lot of flexibility which, if set correctly, can help to speed up visualisation processes as you move with larger and more diverse datasets.

There are different ways to save you map styles:

- As **default** for the layer.
- As a separate 'QML' **file**.

Within one QGIS proyect, one layer can have multiple styles. This helps to keep each project with a minimum number of layers, which in turn helps overall performance.


# Georeferencing Images

Georeferencing is the process of assigning real-world coordinates to each pixel of the digital image or map. This crucial step makes it possible for geospatial data to be accurately placed on the earth's surface in its correct geographical location. By doing so, georeferenced images (rasters) can be used in conjunction with other spatial data (vector) within GIS software like QGIS, allowing for a wide range of analysis and mapping applications.

## Tools and plugins

In QGIS, georeferencing can be carried out using the built-in `Georeferencer` tool, which can be found under the menu `Layer` -> `Georeferencer...`. This tool allows you to manually add control points that link the location on the image with geographic coordinates on the map, adjusting the image to fit the spatial data.

::: {.callout-tip}
The mode nodes you add and the further away from each other, the more refences the algorithm has to accomodate the original file. 
**Minimum of 5 points** should be considered to have an descent baseline.
:::

- **Plugins**: For more advanced or specific georeferencing needs, there are additional plugins like `Freehand Raster Georeferencer`, allowing for more flexible manipulation of images directly within the map canvas.

## Use cases of georeferenced images

- **Historical Maps**: Bringing old maps into modern GIS projects, helping to study changes over time.
- **Tracing Exercises**: Overlaying aerial or satellite imagery to digitize features such as roads, buildings, or land use.
- **Reshaping sketches**: Planning and ideation sketches usually are our of scale and conveniently reshaping elements of the enrionment. Georefereincing them helps to better transition ideas into reality.

:::{.callout}
It's important to consider **potential distortions** when georeferencing images, as the process involves stretching or rotating the image to align with real-world coordinates. Understanding and managing these distortions is key to ensuring the accuracy of the geospatial analysis.

# Exporting Images

Exporting images and maps from QGIS allows you to share GIS projects and findings in a variety of formats suitable for reports, presentations, or online publication.

- **Quick export**
Under the menu `Project` you can directly see the `Import/Export` function that let's you export to different image formats and PDFs. 
Some features need attention (**resolution**, **scale**, and **dimensions**) but the interface should be self explanatory. 

- **Print layouts**
This option is more advanced and allows you to set up multiple _print layouts_ (even it they are just for exporting as images).

With this option you can add elements such as legends, scale bars, texts and even images that help contextualize your maps. This feature is especially useful for creating professional-quality map presentations and detailed spatial analysis reports.

These functionalities in QGIS enhance the ability to **communicate spatial information**, making it accessible to a wider audience, regardless of their GIS expertise.
