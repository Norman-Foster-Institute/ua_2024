# QGIS Mapping

As part of our practical exercises in class, we will focus on the essential skill of drawing street networks using vector data mapping. This exercise is centered on the historic center of San Marino and is designed to enhance your proficiency in inputting geometry. The main task will involve creating a GeoPackage Layer:

- **Street Network layer**: representing the pedestrian routes through the assigned tiles. 

For those interested in exploring further and applying additional GIS skills, we offer the optional task of creating a Buildings layer:

- **Buildings layer** (Optional): representing all the buildings within the assigned tiles.

This approach allows you to focus on the critical aspect of mapping the street network, with the option to delve into building mapping as an additional challenge. 

## Connecting to DB
Although the exercise is primarily based on local data manipulation, connecting to NFI's database is recommended to access the reference grid and familiarize yourself with its structure. The database is read-only for scholars, ensuring no accidental modifications.

## Mapping Vector Data

We will use the historic center of San Marino for this exercise, aiming to familiarize you with inputting geometry. Attributes will be considered at later stages. Each scholar can produce individual GeoPackage Layers (locally):

- **Street Network layer** (Linestring, `CRS: 3035`) is the primary focus, emphasizing the mapping of pedestrian routes.
    - Suggested name: *network_[scholarname]*
- **Buildings layer**  (Polygons, `CRS: 3035`) for those who wish to further challenge themselves by mapping the area's buildings.
    - Suggested name: *buildings_[scholarname]*

Scholars will refer to specific areas of the republic found in the `nfi` database path:
    - `nfi.sanmarino.base_mapping`

Explore the `street_network` attribute to see your areas and collaborate with neighboring tiles.

## Contextual Resources for Mapping
Use `OSM` or `Bing maps` XYZ Tiles, as detailed in our previous lesson, for a better understanding of your mapping area. The [3D CESIUM Story](https://ion.cesium.com/stories/viewer/?id=0806b0b0-46ac-4a95-9410-92cac329574b) offers a 3D view of the 2D polygons you'll be mapping, enhancing your perspective and accuracy.

Activate the `Snapping Toolbar` for precision in mapping. Experiment with different pixel tolerance values and options like `Topological Editing` and `Intersection Snapping`.

## Contextual Resources for Mapping
For a better understanding of your mapping area, utilize `OSM` or `Bing maps` XYZ Tiles as detailed in our [previous lesson](chapter_1/qgis.qmd). Additionally, explore the [3D CESIUM Story](https://ion.cesium.com/stories/viewer/?id=0806b0b0-46ac-4a95-9410-92cac329574b) for an immersive 3D view of the 2D polygons and lines you will be mapping. These resources will enhance your perspective and accuracy in representing San Marino's historic center.

## Rules for Correctly Drawing the Street Network

To ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the street network layer you create, follow these guidelines:

- **Intersection to Intersection**: A 'street' should be mapped from one intersection to another. If the street continues beyond an intersection, it should be added as an additional feature. A single street can have several intermediate points, but the fewer, the better.
- **Snapping**: All beginnings and ends of streets must be snapped to each other to enable correct analysis and connectivity within the network.
- **Boundary Responsibility**: For the edges of your assigned tiles, you are responsible for mapping features that cross the bottom and right boundaries. This means if a street or building extends beyond these edges, you should include it in your drawing. Conversely, features that extend beyond the top or left boundaries of your tile are the responsibility of your neighboring scholars. Therefore, you can omit such streets or buildings, assuming they will be covered by your colleagues' efforts.
- **Unique ID Column**: Ideally, each table should have at least one ID column with no duplicates. 
    - In QGIS, you can ensure uniqueness by using the "Field Calculator" to create a new field. Use an expression like `@row_number` to automatically assign a unique number to each feature.
- **Minimizing Elements**: The most effective street network is one described using the fewest number of elements while still accurately representing all possible connections. Strive for simplicity and completeness in your mapping.

### Extra Mile 
Engage further by combining tiles with your adjacent neighbors and/or adding attributes to your layers, especially if you choose to work on the optional Buildings layer.

When merging files, ensure that all Linestrings (from the Network layer) and Polygon edges are appropriately snapped.
