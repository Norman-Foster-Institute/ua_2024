## To-Dos

- Create a table with the following characteristics.
    
    Use schema. `ua0`
    
    Table name : `[yourinitials] + ‚Äú_prof_exp‚Äù`
    
    Fields required: (assign data types as you think would be best)
    
    - `id`
    - `scholar_id`
    - `industry_id`
    - `institution`
    - `years_of_experience`
    - `education`
    - `location` (crs: 4326)
    - `end_year`
    - `notes`
    
    ** If you think more fields are necessary, feel free to add them
    
- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
    - add link to `public.scholars.github_link` (varchar)

### Optional

Create a local instance of PostGIS for use in the upcoming months
