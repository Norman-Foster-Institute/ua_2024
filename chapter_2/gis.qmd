# Intro to GIS

## File types

**Vector** and **raster** data are two fundamental types of spatial data used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Vector data represents geographical features as distinct shapes using points, lines, and polygons, each of which can carry detailed attribute information, making it ideal for precise mapping applications like boundaries, roads, and infrastructure networks. It excels in accuracy and detail for discrete data. In contrast, raster data consists of a grid of pixels, each holding a value, effectively representing continuous data. This format is well-suited for environmental analysis, land cover studies, and satellite imagery, as it captures variations over a wide area, such as elevation, temperature, or vegetation. While vector data is preferred for its precision in depicting specific geographic entities and managing related data, raster data is favored for its ability to represent complex, continuous phenomena over large spatial scales.

### Vector

#### Types

Vector data types are primarily categorized into Points, Lines, and Polygons, each with distinct characteristics and uses. Additionally, there are multi-geometry versions of these types, like Multi-Points, Multi-Lines, etc., which offer more complex representations.

- **Points**: In vector GIS, Points are used to represent discrete locations on the earth's surface. Each point is defined by a pair of coordinates (e.g. latitude and longitude) and can represent features like the location of a city, a well, or a landmark.
- **Lines**: Lines are sequences of points connected by straight segments. They are used to represent linear features such as roads, rivers, or utility lines. Lines are characterized by length and direction and can also include attributes like road type or river name.
- **Polygons**: Polygons are closed shapes formed by a series of connected line segments. They are used to represent areas such as city boundaries, land parcels, or lakes. Polygons have attributes such as area and perimeter and can include additional information like population density or land use type.

- **Multi-Geometry Versions**:
  - **Multi-Points**: This type represents a collection of points as a single entity. For instance, a Multi-Point could represent a chain of islands or a group of dispersed historical sites.
  - **Multi-Lines (or Multi-Polylines)**: These are collections of lines that are treated as a single feature. An example might be the total network of streets in a city or various segments of a long-distance hiking trail.
  - **Multi-Polygons**: This type includes several polygons that are associated but not physically connected, like the different parcels of a dispersed national park or the territories of a country spread over several islands.

#### Formats

**Esri Shapefile**

Shapefile is a prevalent geospatial file type in GIS software, requiring three mandatory files: `SHP` (feature geometry), `SHX` (shape index position), and `DBF` (attribute data). Optional files like `PRJ` (coordinate reference system) are also common.

**GeoPackage**

GeoPackage, a portable and compact format, is ideal for transferring geospatial information. Based on SQLite, it supports vector data, tile matrix sets, and extensions. It's efficient for storing multiple data layers and a popular alternative to shapefiles for handling larger datasets.

**GeoJSON**

GeoJSON encodes geographic data structures using JSON. Common in online mapping applications, it represents geographic features like points, lines, and polygons in an open-standard format. |

### Raster

Rasters contain a grid of pixels, where the value used for each grid cell can represent a characteristic such as temperature or landcover. Geographic rasters typically include Geospatial information necessary to correctly project and locate the information in GIS software.

#### Formats

**ASCII Grid**

ASCII Grid files (`ASC`) store raster data as text in a grid format. Each cell in the grid is represented by a numeric value (which can be a float), corresponding to the geographic attribute being mapped, such as elevation. ASCII Grid files include a header specifying metadata like cell size, number of rows and columns, and coordinates of the lower left corner. The format is simple and can be generated or edited with a text editor, making it versatile for GIS data storage and exchange. Commonly used as an interchange format, it can be space, comma, or tab-delimited.

**GeoTIFF**

GeoTIFF is a widely used file format in GIS and remote sensing applications, known for its ability to embed georeferencing information within a standard TIFF (Tagged Image File Format). It stores raster images and allows embedding of metadata such as map projections, coordinate systems, ellipsoids, and datums. This embedded geospatial data enables the precise positioning of the image in the correct geographic space. GeoTIFFs are commonly used for storing satellite imagery, aerial photography, and GIS data.

## Coordinate Reference Systems

Geographic data is intrinsically tied to the earth's surface and is represented using coordinates within defined Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS). Broadly, these systems fall into two categories: **Geographic** Coordinate Systems and **Projected** Coordinate Systems.

Geographic CRSs use a three-dimensional spherical surface to define locations on the earth. They are based on latitude and longitude measurements and are most commonly referenced to the WGS84 datum. While they accurately represent the earth's curved surface and preserve the true shape and angular relationships of features, distances and areas may not be as accurate, especially over larger areas.

Projected CRSs translate the earth's three-dimensional surface onto a two-dimensional plane, making it easier to analyze and visualize spatial data. They use a mathematical projection to flatten the curved surface of the earth, which can lead to distortions in shape, area, distance, or direction. Different types of projections are designed to minimize these distortions for specific regions or purposes. For example, some are optimized for preserving area (equal-area projections), while others preserve distances or shapes.

### Geographic

Geographic _Coordinate Reference Systems_ (CRS) use a three-dimensional spherical or ellipsoidal surface to represent locations on the Earth's curved surface. Geographic CRSs are based on latitude and longitude coordinates and are useful for global or regional mapping.

- **Units**: Degrees
- **Common Examples:**
  - **WGS 84 (World Geodetic System 1984)** `EPSG:4326`: A widely used CRS for global mapping and GPS navigation.
  - **NAD83 (North American Datum 1983)** `EPSG:4269`: A CRS commonly used in North America.

### Projected

Projected _Coordinate Reference Systems_ (CRS) use a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system to represent locations on a flat surface. These CRSs are created by "projecting" the curved Earth onto a flat surface, which introduces distortions. This inevitably requires tradeoffs in distances, areas, or shapes, with different projection systems involving different trade-offs. Projected CRSs are commonly used for local or small-scale mapping appropriate to specific countries or regions of the globe, where locally accurate measurements and comparisons are required.

- **Units**: Meters (most commonly)
- **Common Examples:**
  - **UTM Zone 30N (ETRS89)** `EPSG:3035`: This CRS is commonly used in Europe (around latitude 30Â° North).
  - **British National Grid (BNG)** `EPSG:27700`: This CRS is commonly used in the United Kingdom.
  - **State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS)**: This CRS is widely used in the United States for local or regional mapping.

## GIS Data

### Sources

Discovering sources for GIS (Geographic Information System) data is a handy skill for spatial analysis and mapping! There are various official and non-official sources, each offering different types of data suited to specific needs and applications. When searching for and using different data sources, try to remain cognisant of the merits and limitations of different sources, which may impact considerations such as data accuracy or bias.

- **Government Agencies:** National agencies often provide official and reliable forms of GIS data. However, these datasets may reflect governmental priorities and perspectives or they may be reluctant to make these datasets openly available.
- **International Organizations:** Organizations such as the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank offer global GIS datasets, but these may have limited local detail due to their broad scope.
- **Local Authorities:** City and regional councils often create and maintain local GIS datasets, often tailored to specific local government projects and priorities.
- **Private Sector:** There are many private sector organisations which generate, curate, or distribute data, however, these datasets are less likely to be openly available and may incur substantial monetary cost.
- **Open Data Platforms:** Platforms such as OpenStreetMap offer freely accessible GIS data, contributed by a community of users. These datasets might require additional validation if used for mission-critical purposes, though can otherwise be extremely useful, allowing for generalisable workflows and providing coverage in some instances where no other options exist.
- **APIs and Web Scraping:** Involves the automated collection of data from APIs or websites. The quality of data can vary but may otherwise be useful for obtaining interesting data. These techniques may involve significant technical skills for data extraction and processing. Legal and ethical considerations are important, as scraping can sometimes violate terms of service or data privacy laws.

### Purposely Collected Data

Purposely collected data is gathered specifically to address a certain research question or project goal, using structured approaches like surveys, experiments, or observations. It's tailored to meet the specific needs of a study, with careful control over variables to ensure the data's relevance and accuracy. This type of data is highly pertinent to the project it's collected for, due to its focused nature and methodical collection process.

### Adapted Data

On the other hand, adapted data refers to information originally collected for different purposes, but later used for new research needs. It includes data from various sources such as public databases, previous studies, or web scraping. This data is characterized by its broad range of collection goals and the diverse methods used in its initial gathering. Its versatility lies in the ability to repurpose existing data for new or unrelated research questions, making it a flexible resource in research contexts.

## Attribution

Attribution or citation refers to giving proper credit to the original source or creator of the data. Just as with citing sources in academic papers, it's important to acknowledge the origin of the data you are using. This helps provide transparency, accountability, and recognition to the creators of the dataset.

### Licenses:

When dealing with data, licenses refer to legal agreements or permissions that determine how the data can be used, distributed, or modified. Different datasets may have different licensing requirements, so it's important to understand and comply with the specific license terms associated with the data you are using.

Examples:

- **Creative Commons (CC) licenses**: These are standardized licenses that allow creators to specify permissions for their work. They are commonly used for a variety of creative works, including images, music, videos, and written content.

- **Open Government Licenses**: These licenses have been adopted by governments and may allow individuals and organizations permissive use, reuse, and sharing of information.

- **GNU General Public License (GPL)**: This is a copyleft license for open-source software. It permits users to modify and distribute the software, but any modifications or derivative works must also be licensed under the GPL. This license is popular for promoting open-source principles and collaborative software development.

- **MIT / Apache / BSD Licenses**: Permissive open-source software licenses. These may allow great flexibility such as using, copying, modifying, and distributing derivative work, even for commercial purposes. The primary requirement is to include the original copyright and license notice in any significant portions of the software.

## Privacy

Privacy considerations are important when working with data, especially if the data contains personally identifiable information or sensitive information. It's very important to handle and store data in a way that respects privacy laws and regulations. This may involve anonymizing or de-identifying data, implementing security measures, and obtaining consent from individuals whose data is being used.

::: {.callout-note}
Please avoid using any and all data containing private or sensitive data unless you first review this and seek approval from faculty. Handling these forms of data comes with numerous steps and safeguards and will generally be strongly discouraged.

## Quirks (Part 1)

### MAUP

The **Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)** is a common issue in geography and maps. It refers to the fact that the results of statistical analysis or visual representation can be influenced by the **choice of spatial unit or scale used to aggregate data**. The MAUP arises because geographic phenomena can be measured and analysed at different levels of spatial granularity, such as census tracts, counties, or regions. When data is aggregated into different spatial units, it can lead to different patterns, relationships, and **interpretations**.

**Crime Rates**: Imagine you have crime data recorded at the neighborhoud level. If you aggregate the data into larger units, such as police precincts, the crime rates may appear different due to the varying sizes and characteristics of neighborhouds within each precinct. This can result in different spatial patterns and potentially lead to incorrect conclusions about crime rates at different scales or units of analysis.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NTw1v7DuAA&t=115s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NTw1v7DuAA&t=115s)

These examples demonstrate how the choice of spatial unit can significantly impact the analysis and interpretation of geographic data, highlighting the need to use consistency with the scale, units, and boundaries of spatial analysis.
