## Overview

Welcome to the first **hands-on** section of the course where you will familiarise yourself with Jupyter Lab for running Python 'Notebooks'.

This guide assumes the prior installation of Anaconda as detailed previously.

### Creating an Environment

Create a new "environment" the first time you use Anaconda. Environments ensure that packages remain self-contained and make it easier to synchronise packages without unnecessary contamination from unrelated projects.

- Open Anaconda Navigator.
- Click on Environments
- Click to create a new environment called `nfi`.
- Select the newly created `nfi` environment from the list of environments.
- In the right pane, change the dropdown view mode to "Not Installed".
- Search for `jupyterlab`, then select it and click to install.
- Select the Home button to return to the main view.

### Launching Jupyter Lab

To launch Juptyer Lab:

- Open Anaconda Navigator.
- Using the top dropdown menus, select "All applications" and select the newly created "nfi" environment.
- Click to launch "Jupyter Lab" from the list of applications. This will launch a new Jupyter Lab instance in a web browser.
- Use the "Python 3" kernel if prompted.

::: {.callout-tip}
Don't confuse the "Jupyer Lab" with the "Jupyter Notebook" apps. The former is a newer replacement for the latter.

### Opening a Python Notebook

You can now create a new Notebook or, otherwise, open an existing Python Notebook. Notebooks are composed of cells.

Cells can be either code (Python) or text (Markdown). A typical notebook consists of a series of cells where some include text with explanations or background information, while others contain the executable code, either waiting for execution or already executed. The cells with the executed code will display outputs once the cell has been run. The individual code cells can be "played" to see how the code actions unfold from step to step.

You can try creating your own cell content and experimenting with running the cells. Remember that the cells are only aware of previously run cells. We can start with simple math that Python can do natively. Run the following code cell in your notebook. After inserting the text, you can either click the “play” button or press the <span class="keystroke">Shift</span> + <span class="keystroke">Enter</span> keys.

```{python}
1 + 1
# this will return 2 if once the cell is run
```

### Closing Jupyter Lab

Shut down Jupyter Lab from the menubar in the web interface using [File]{.keystroke} > [Shut Down]{.keystroke}.

### Plan B with Google Colab

If you are unable to install an environment using the instructions above, you can follow the course using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). You will need to install any required packages to your Colab environment. Reach out in class if you need help getting set up.

### Plan C with the command line

It is also possible to install and run Python environments and packages from the command line using, for example, the Terminal window in a Mac, or the corresponding environment on Windows. Details for installation and usage are different for different systems.
