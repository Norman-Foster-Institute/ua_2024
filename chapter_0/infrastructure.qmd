The course does not use any specific resources. It is designed to run entirely
on students' machines using solely open-source software.

## Communication

Scholars enrolled in the Sustainable Cities program at the Norman Foster Institute have been 
added to a Google Spaces for online discussion. Scholars are encouraged to use the platform to seek
help from peers, share thoughts and tips, and other meaningful contributions the rest of the
group can benefit from. Learn from the mistakes of the others.

The tutor will be part of the discussion forum but the priority is to help each other,
rather than seek guidance outside of class.

## Software stack

There are many options on how to run Python. You may already have a copy on your machine,
you can run it in the browser and install it in a myriad ways. This course uses
what is considered a standard for **scientific** computing based on two key components -
a package manager (you will be using `mamba`, built on top `conda`) and an interface (Jupyter Lab).

The basics will be explained in the first lesson but it would be beneficial if you could create
an environment before the class.

### Create an environment

To run the course material, you will need a Python environment with all the packages for
spatial data science installed. Unless you already know how to work with `conda` or `mamba`,
follow the instructions below.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Windows

::: {.callout-caution}
Windows may complain that the app is not recognised. Click _More information_ and you will be able to run the installer.
:::

1. Download `miniforge` package manager from [Github](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#download){.external target="_blank"} for your operating system.
2. Execute the installer and make sure to create start menu shortcuts (there's a tick box during installation).
3. Open the installed `Miniforge Prompt` application.
4. Create a Python environment using the following command:

```sh
mamba env create -f https://github.com/Norman-Foster-Institute/ua_2024/blob/main/environment.yml
```

5. Activate the environment using:

```sh
mamba activate nfiua
```

6. Start JupyterLab interface:

```sh
jupyter lab
```

::: {.callout-important}
Ensure that you install `miniforge` in a directory without any special characters in the name. It may occasionally break things.
:::

### macOS & Linux

1. Download `miniforge` package manager from [Github](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#download){.external target="_blank"} for your operating system and install it.
3. Open `Terminal` application.
4. Create a Python environment using the following command:

```sh
mamba env create -f https://github.com/Norman-Foster-Institute/ua_2024/blob/main/environment.yml
```

5. Activate the environment using:

```sh
mamba activate nfiua
```

6. Start JupyterLab interface:

```sh
jupyter lab
```
:::

A Jupyter Lab interface will show up in your browser. If it hasn't opened automatically, copy the link printed in your command line/terminal.

### Closing Jupyter Lab

The best way to close the Jupyter Lab and shut down its process running in the terminal is to use the Jupyter Lab's interface. In the menu find [File]{.keystroke} > [Shut Down]{.keystroke}.

### Opening Jupyter Lab next time

The steps above are needed only the first time. Once you create the environment, it won't disappear and you can use it until you don't delete it. Once you close Jupyter Lab session, you can always start a new one:

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Windows

1. Open `Miniforge Prompt`
2. Activate the environment:

```sh
mamba activate nfiua
```

3. Start JupyterLab interface:

```sh
jupyter lab
```

### macOS & Linux

1. Open `Terminal`
2. Activate the environment:

```sh
mamba activate nfiua
```

3. Start JupyterLab interface:

```sh
jupyter lab
```

:::

### Plan B with Google Colab

If you are unable to install an environment using the instructions above, you can follow
the course using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). You will just need to install the required packages to
your Colab environment. Reach out in class or via Discord if you need to set it up.

### Troubleshooting

In case of any issues related to environment creation, reach out in the class or via Google Spaces.
