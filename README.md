> This README.md file discusses authoring and publishing content. If you are following the lessons in this course you can safely ignore this document. See `hello.qmd` instead.

- Install `quarto` on your system
  - Go to `quarto` [Get Started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and install the `quarto` binary for your system.
  - If you're on a mac, you can alternatively install through the `brew` package manager (if you have it installed). For example, `brew install quarto`.
- Install the `vscode` `quarto` extension.
- This adds a Preview button to your `.qmd`, and `.ipynb` files which will dynamically render the content to a separate pane in `vscode`.
- If using conda, make sure it is installed and that you install the packages listed in the `.yaml` file.
- Alternatively, use the `pdm` package manager to install the packages in the `pyproject.toml` file, for example, `pdm install`.
